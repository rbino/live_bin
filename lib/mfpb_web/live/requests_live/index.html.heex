    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      <b>mfpb</b> is a simple tool used to inspect HTTP requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      It tries not to get in your way, it doesn't parse the body or do other
      fancy stuff with your request. This way you see exactly what was sent.
      The idea is basically having the same output you would get by doing HTTP
      requests to a listening instance of <code>netcat</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the hood it uses the super cool
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix Live View</a>,
      so new requests are prepended at the top of the page without the need of
      refreshing.
